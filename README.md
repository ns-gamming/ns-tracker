⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a .env file in project root (example):

VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXX
VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here

> Keep secrets out of the repo. Use Vercel Environment Variables for deployment.




---

🧪 Tests & Linting

Add & run tests (if present):

# Run tests
npm run test

# Lint
npm run lint

Add Git hooks for linting with Husky if you want pre-commit checks.


---

📦 CI / CD (GitHub Actions example)

.github/workflows/ci.yml (example snippet — add to repo if you want):

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run test

Deploy automatically by connecting repo to Vercel (recommended) or GitHub Pages (static export).


---

📈 Deployment (Vercel)

1. Sign into Vercel and import the repo.


2. Set your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.


3. Deploy — Vercel will run a production build and publish your app.




---

🧩 Example Usage (UI flows)

Add income/expense entries → view monthly and cumulative stats

Toggle date ranges to see historical savings rate

Export CSV (future enhancement) for offline analysis



---

🎯 Roadmap

Planned/optional features:

Authentication & multi-user support

CSV import/export for transactions

Charts with zoom & filtering (e.g., recharts)

Notifications & budgeting goals

Mobile app wrapper (Expo / React Native)


If you want to pick a feature from the roadmap and want help implementing it, I can draft the plan and PR for you.

🤝 Contributing

Thanks for helping improve NS FinSight! Please follow these simple steps:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature


2. Commit with clear messages (prefer conventional commits)


3. Open a PR against the main branch with a description and screenshots if UI changed


4. Add tests for new logic and run npm run test


5. Be respectful — follow the code of conduct




---

🧾 Code of Conduct

Be kind and respectful. Report issues or unacceptable behavior via GitHub issues.


---

🛠️ Troubleshooting

If build fails, check Node version (node -v) — use Node 18+ (or project-specified).

If the app loads blank, check console for missing env vars or API errors.

For CSS problems, rebuild Tailwind cache and confirm tailwind.config.js.
